<h2 class="heading2">Essential Information for First-Time Self-Builders in Ireland</h2>
    <section>
    <h3 class="heading3">Types of Building Materials</h3>
    <br>
    <p class="list-text">
    <strong>When embarking on your self-building journey in Ireland, one of
    the first decisions you'll face is choosing the right building
    materials for your home. Here are some common options:</strong>
    </p>
    <br>
    <ol class="list-text">
    <li>
        Traditional Block Construction: This is one of the most
        familiar methods of house construction in Ireland. It involves
        using concrete blocks or bricks to create the walls of the
        house. Traditional block construction is known for its
        durability, sound insulation, and fire resistance. It provides
        a solid structure that can withstand various weather
        conditions. Additionally, it allows for flexibility in terms
        of design and can accommodate various architectural styles.
    </li>
    <li>
        Timber Frame Construction: Timber frame construction has
        gained popularity in recent years due to its energy efficiency
        and speed of construction. In this method, a structural frame
        of timber is used as the main support for the house. The
        spaces between the timber frames are filled with insulation
        material, and the exterior is typically finished with a
        variety of cladding options, such as brick, render, or timber.
        Timber frame construction offers excellent thermal performance
        and can result in reduced heating costs over time.
    </li>
    <li>
        Modular Construction: Modular construction involves building
        individual modules or sections of the house off-site in a
        controlled environment. These modules are then transported to
        the construction site and assembled to create the complete
        house. Modular construction can result in faster construction
        times and reduced site disruption. It's an innovative approach
        that offers design flexibility and can be particularly
        suitable for self-builders.

    <h3 class="heading3">Planning Permission and Regulations</h3>
    <br>
    <p class="list-text">
    <strong>Before breaking ground on your self-build project, it's crucial
    to familiarize yourself with planning regulations:</strong>
    </p>
    <br>
    <ol class="list-text">
        <li>
        Local Authority Approval: You'll need to obtain planning
        permission from your local authority before starting
        construction. Ensure your design adheres to zoning and
        building regulations.
        </li>
        <li>
        Building Control Regulations: Compliance with building control
        regulations ensures the safety and quality of your home. These
        regulations cover areas such as structural integrity, fire
        safety, and energy efficiency.
        </li>
        <li>
        Site Development: Consider factors like site drainage, access,
        and utilities connection. Your site should meet legal
        requirements and infrastructure needs.
